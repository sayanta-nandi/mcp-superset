## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Bulk role operations were broken** — `superset_bulk_user_role_add`, `superset_bulk_user_role_remove`, `superset_bulk_user_role_replace` and `superset_role_copy_permissions` passed `json=` instead of `json_data=` to the client, raising `TypeError` at apply time (dry-run was unaffected, so it went unnoticed).
- **DDL/DML guard in `superset_sqllab_execute` could be bypassed** — the check only inspected the first keyword, so `WITH ... DELETE`, chained `SELECT 1; DROP ...`, parenthesised `(DELETE ...)`, `EXPLAIN ... DELETE`, `COPY` and `DO $$ BEGIN EXECUTE '...' END $$` (DDL hidden in a string literal) slipped through. It now matches dangerous keywords (including `DO`/`EXECUTE`) as whole words anywhere in the query, after stripping comments and string literals, and names the most specific operation in the rejection message.
- **List pagination ignored `page`/`page_size`** — most `*_list` tools (including `superset_group_list`) sent them as plain query params, which Superset ignores (always returning the first page). They now use RISON pagination via the new `client.get_page()` helper. Custom endpoints (`recent_activity`, `tag/get_objects`) keep query params, as they genuinely read them.
- **CSRF token was never refreshed on expiry** — a stale CSRF (which has its own, shorter lifetime than the JWT) caused a 400 with no retry. The client now detects CSRF-related 400s and retries once with a fresh token, without masking genuine validation errors.
- **`granularity_sqla` guard was too strict** — it blocked legitimate non-temporal charts (maps, pie, word cloud, hierarchical). It is now required only for viz types that actually have a temporal axis.
- **Unhandled `JSONDecodeError` on malformed JSON arguments** — tools accepting JSON strings (`columns`, `metrics`, `recipients`, `query_context`, `objects_to_tag`, `tags`, `position_json`, `filters_json`) now return a structured `{"error": ...}` instead of crashing.
- **Auto-sync of `datasource_access`** used `PUT .../permissions/` (trailing slash) instead of the working `POST .../permissions`, so access grants on dashboard/chart create/update silently failed.

### Changed

- Removed reference to a non-existent `superset_rls_create_unsafe` tool in the Base RLS rejection message.
- Consolidated three near-duplicate `datasource_access` permission lookups into a single `find_datasource_permissions` helper.
- Standardised the dataset `related_objects` endpoint to a trailing slash, matching the database endpoint.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Bulk role operations** (4 new tools):
  - `superset_bulk_user_role_add` — add a role to multiple users (by user IDs or by current role filter)
  - `superset_bulk_user_role_remove` — remove a role from multiple users (prevents removing last role)
  - `superset_bulk_user_role_replace` — replace one role with another for all users who have it
  - `superset_role_copy_permissions` — copy all permissions from one role to another
  - All bulk operations support dry-run mode and exclude Admin users by default
- **Improved permissions audit** (`superset_permissions_audit`):
  - Now checks both dashboard visibility (via `dashboard.roles`) AND `datasource_access`
  - Three access states: `1` (full access), `0` (no access), `"visible_no_data"` (can open dashboard but charts fail)
  - Previously only checked `datasource_access`, missing role-based dashboard visibility

### Changed

- Total tools count: 119 (was 115)
